    <h1><b>The Importance of Italian Cuisine</b></h1>
    <p>
      Italian cuisine (Italian: Cucina italiana) is a Mediterranean cuisine
      consisting of the ingredients, recipes and cooking techniques developed
      across the Italian Peninsula since antiquity, and later spread around the
      world together with waves of Italian diaspora. Significant changes
      occurred with the colonization of the Americas and the introduction of
      potatoes, tomatoes, capsicums, maize and sugar beet â€” the latter
      introduced in quantity in the 18th century. It is one of the best-known
      and most appreciated gastronomies worldwide.

      Spaghetti is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical

      food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta, spaghetti is made
      of milled wheat and water and sometimes enriched with vitamins and
      minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum wheat semolina.
      Usually the pasta is white because refined flour is used, but whole wheat
      flour may be added. Spaghettoni is a thicker form of spaghetti, while
      capellini is a very thin spaghetti.
